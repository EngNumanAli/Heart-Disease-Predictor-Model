🫀 Heart Disease Prediction App using Machine Learning & Streamlit
📋 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on several health parameters such as age, gender, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.
The model was trained using the scikit-learn library and deployed with Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.
